"""End-to-end collective closure: Step0..Step6 driven by the compiled table.

This is the model's integration point. Given a compiled route table and the
payload geometry, it runs one collective phase the way the design describes:

======  ==========================================================================
Step    model action
======  ==========================================================================
Step1   the caller guarantees ``sendTile`` is ready (producer ordering)
Step2   all members share the same ``opcode`` domain and the same epoch
Step3   each member posts ``MTE4_NOC_RECV_WAIT`` with its own ``expVal``
Step4   each member sends from its own row of the table
Step4s  a non-self-delivering fabric's local segment is written by UB-to-UB copy
Step5   drains the sends, then checks that every ``expVal`` was reached
Step6   retires the accounts and reports
======  ==========================================================================

The ordering invariants are enforced, not assumed: Step3 precedes Step4 (O3), the
epoch is uniform across members (E1), and the completion test is byte accounting
rather than a notification.

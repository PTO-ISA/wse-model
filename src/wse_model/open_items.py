"""Registry of design values the sources leave open.

Whitepaper Appendix A (`Q1`-`Q12`) and Calendar §6.3 (`S-1`-`S-7`,
`C-1`-`C-12`) list values and choices that the design documents explicitly do
not fix. This module records them so that the model can reference an item by id
instead of smuggling a plausible default into the code.

The rule (see ``AGENTS.md``): a parameter that stands in for an open item must
carry the item id and a :class:`Resolution`, and code that would produce a
result with a materially different answer under the other reading must call
:func:`require_resolved` first.

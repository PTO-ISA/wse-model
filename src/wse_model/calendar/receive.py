"""The receive side: byte accounting against ``expVal``.

Calendar §4.5 defines the one genuinely new instruction of the design,
``MTE4_NOC_RECV_WAIT(dst, capacity, expVal, opcode, epoch)``. It **moves no
bytes**: the payload is written into the core's arena directly by the NoC, and
MTE4 only *accounts*. A receive command retires once the valid payload bytes
that match ``{opcode, epoch, dstRange}`` and are already committed reach
``expVal``.

That turns "the collective is complete" from a distributed protocol problem into
a local counter problem. The price is that the accounting must be exact, so this
module implements the seven P0 contracts of §4.5.2 as explicit, fail-closed
checks:

1. the unit is valid payload **bytes** — no header, CRC, padding, retransmit
   copy, or self-sourced byte counts;
2. only writes inside ``[dst, dst + capacity)`` matching the current
   ``{opcode, epoch}`` count; anything else is discarded **and faults**;
3. accounting happens after the payload is committed and readable — MTE4
   completion is therefore an acquire;
4. legal arrivals that predate the command but belong to the same established
   epoch must not be missed;
5. duplicate packets must not be double counted, including multicast forked
   copies per land point;
6. ``expVal == 0`` completes immediately; ``expVal > capacity``, a mismatch with
   the compiled value, or counter overflow faults — never a silent permanent
   block;
7. because ``opcode`` is a weak discriminator (every AllGather shares
   ``opcode = 1``), ``collectionEpoch`` carries the entire discrimination duty.

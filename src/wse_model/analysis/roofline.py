"""The roofline arithmetic that motivates the whole WSE design.

Whitepaper §1 and §19: WSE trades bandwidth for latency, and the trade is
quantified by one ratio. Per AICORE the balance point is::

    balance = Cube FLOP/s / local DRAM bytes/s

which is **11.5 FLOP/Byte at FP16**, 45.9 at FP8, and 91.8 at FP4. A decode-stage
GEMV has an arithmetic intensity of about ``2 x batch`` FLOP/Byte, because each
weight byte is used once. Dividing the balance point by 2 gives the batch at
which decode stops being memory-bound: about 6 at FP16, 23 at FP8, 46 at FP4.

The design's sharper point (whitepaper §19.2) is that lowering precision helps a
memory-bound operator because it **halves the bytes**, not because it quadruples
the FLOPs — which is why FP8/FP4 accuracy matters more than peak throughput here.
